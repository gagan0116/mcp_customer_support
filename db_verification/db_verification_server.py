You are selecting the most likely order for a customer support request.

Context:
We are using this selection step ONLY because the email did NOT contain a usable invoice number or order_invoice_id.
So you MUST NOT rely on those identifiers.

You are given two JSON objects:

1) customer_orders_payload:
- Contains customer info and a list of orders.
- Each order includes a list of items.

2) email_info:
- Extracted/structured info from the customer's email.
- It may include item names, SKUs, quantities, amounts, currency, shipping location, and date hints.
- It does NOT include a reliable invoice number or order_invoice_id.

Task:
Choose the SINGLE best matching order from customer_orders_payload using only non-identifier details such as:
- item names / SKUs / categories
- quantities
- mentioned amount vs order total (allow small tolerance)
- shipping city/state/country (if mentioned)
- order recency hints in the email (e.g., "last week", "recent order") using order_date/delivered_at as context

Important rules:
- Prefer matches with clear item/SKU overlap.
- If multiple orders seem plausible, do NOT guess. Return up to 3 candidates.
- If there is not enough evidence to choose, set selected_order_id to null.

Return ONLY valid JSON in exactly this schema (no extra text):
{{
  "selected_order_id": string | null,
  "confidence": number,   // 0 to 1
  "reason": string,
  "candidates": [
    {{"order_id": string, "reason": string}}
