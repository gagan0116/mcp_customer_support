  "description": "Here's a detailed description of an illustrative figure representing the Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph Construction Pipeline, based on the provided methodology section and figure caption:\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe diagram follows a left-to-right sequential flow, representing the data pipeline. The agents are arranged horizontally, with the feedback loop from the Critic Agent creating a visual loop back to the Extraction Agent. The diagram has a clean, professional look suitable for a technical architecture document. The background is a very light cream color.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Start Point (Input):**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Policy PDFs\" in bold sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle is a document icon (crisp, modern style).\n    *   **Color:** Soft white fill with a thin steel blue border.\n    *   **Location:** Far left of the diagram.\n\n2.  **Ingestion Agent:**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Ingestion Agent\" in bold sans-serif font.\n    *   **Color:** Light lavender fill with a slightly darker lavender border.\n    *   **Process Annotation:** Below the box, in smaller sans-serif font, the word \"Parsing\" is displayed.\n\n3.  **Ontology Designer Agent:**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Ontology Designer Agent\" in bold sans-serif font. A brain icon is included inside the box.\n    *   **Color:** Light peach fill with a slightly darker peach border.\n    *   **Process Annotation:** Below the box, in smaller sans-serif font, the phrase \"Gemini Thinking Mode\" is displayed.\n\n4.  **Extraction Agent:**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Extraction Agent\" in bold sans-serif font.\n    *   **Color:** Light mint green fill with a slightly darker mint green border.\n    *   **Process Annotations:** Three lines below the box, each representing a phase, in smaller sans-serif font:\n        *   \"Phase 1: Triplet Extraction (LLM)\"\n        *   \"Phase 2: Graph Linker (Code validation)\"\n        *   \"Phase 3: Cypher Generation\"\n\n5.  **Critic Agent:**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Critic Agent\" in bold sans-serif font.\n    *   **Color:** Light coral fill with a slightly darker coral border.\n    *   **Decision Diamond:** A diamond shape immediately to the right of the Critic Agent box, labeled \"Is Valid?\" in bold sans-serif font. The diamond has a white fill and a thin dark gray dashed border.\n\n6.  **Graph Builder Agent:**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Graph Builder Agent\" in bold sans-serif font.\n    *   **Color:** Light sky blue fill with a slightly darker sky blue border.\n\n7.  **End Point (Output):**\n    *   **Element:** A rounded rectangle labeled \"Knowledge Graph\" in bold sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle is a network/graph visualization icon.\n    *   **Color:** Soft white fill with a thin steel blue border.\n    *   **Location:** Far right of the diagram. To the right, a cylinder database icon representing the Neo4j Database is displayed.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n1.  **Policy PDFs to Ingestion Agent:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Policy PDFs\" rounded rectangle to the \"Ingestion Agent\" box.\n\n2.  **Ingestion Agent to Ontology Designer Agent:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Ingestion Agent\" box to the \"Ontology Designer Agent\" box. Label: \"Hierarchy Markdown\" in italicized sans-serif font (a miniature document icon could be placed along the arrow).\n\n3.  **Ingestion Agent to Extraction Agent:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Ingestion Agent\" box to the \"Extraction Agent\" box. Label: \"Hierarchy Markdown\" in italicized sans-serif font (a miniature document icon could be placed along the arrow).\n\n4.  **Ontology Designer Agent to Extraction Agent:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Ontology Designer Agent\" box to the \"Extraction Agent\" box. Label: \"Graph Schema\" in italicized sans-serif font (a miniature JSON structure icon could be placed along the arrow).\n\n5.  **Extraction Agent to Critic Agent:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Extraction Agent\" box to the \"Critic Agent\" box. Label: \"Extracted Cypher\" in italicized sans-serif font (a miniature code block icon could be placed along the arrow).\n\n6.  **Critic Agent (NO) to Extraction Agent (Feedback Loop):** A curved, dashed arrow (RED, thick) points from the \"Is Valid?\" diamond back to the \"Extraction Agent\" box. Label: \"Improvement Feedback\" in italicized sans-serif font. The arrow's path should be clearly visible and distinct.\n\n7.  **Critic Agent (YES) to Graph Builder Agent:** A solid arrow (GREEN, medium thickness) points from the \"Is Valid?\" diamond to the \"Graph Builder Agent\" box.\n\n8.  **Graph Builder Agent to Knowledge Graph:** A solid arrow (dark gray, medium thickness) points from the \"Graph Builder Agent\" box to the \"Neo4j Database\" and then to the \"Knowledge Graph\" rounded rectangle.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   Each agent (Ingestion, Ontology Designer, Extraction, Critic, Graph Builder) is distinctly colored, making them visually separate and easy to identify.\n*   The entire diagram is contained within a very light cream background.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   All labels are clear and legible, using a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n*   The labels on the arrows indicate the data being passed between agents (Hierarchy Markdown, Graph Schema, Extracted Cypher, Improvement Feedback) in italicized sans-serif font.\n*   The decision diamond is clearly labeled \"Is Valid?\" in bold sans-serif font.\n*   Agent names are prominent and easily readable in bold sans-serif font.\n*   Annotations below the agents provide more detail about their processes in smaller sans-serif font.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   The input is \"Policy PDFs\" (document icon).\n*   The output is \"Knowledge Graph\" (network/graph visualization icon) and the Neo4j Database (cylinder database icon).\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   The diagram has a clean and modern aesthetic.\n*   Use a consistent color palette throughout.\n*   The icons are high-quality and visually appealing.\n*   The arrows are clearly visible and do not overlap unnecessarily.\n*   The \"Critic Feedback Loop\" is visually emphasized using a red dashed arrow.\n*   All shapes have a subtle, soft shadow to give them a sense of depth.\n*   The heading for the diagram, placed above, is \"Architectural Diagram of the Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph Pipeline\" in bold sans-serif font.\n",
