  "description": "## Figure Description:\n\nThis figure is a modern \"Bento Box\" style diagram representing the Google Technology Stack, showcasing the integration of Gemini AI models with Google Cloud Serverless and Data infrastructure. The diagram is strictly aligned in four columns, adhering to a professional technical documentation standard. The background is a deep slate gray. A clean white background is also acceptable.\n\n**Header:** At the top of the diagram, spanning all four columns, is the title \"GOOGLE TECHNOLOGY STACK\" in a large, bold, sans-serif font.\n\n**Column 1: AI Models (Gemini Purple/Blue Theme)**\n\n*   **Container:** A tall, prominent card with gently rounded corners and a subtle gradient fill transitioning from a light lavender at the top to a soft sky blue at the bottom. The card has a thin, solid border in a slightly darker shade of lavender.\n*   **Content:** Four rectangular boxes stacked vertically within the container. Each box has a white background and contains the name of an AI model in a clear, sans-serif font. A very subtle drop shadow adds depth.\n    *   Box 1: `gemini-3-pro-preview`\n    *   Box 2: `gemini-3-flash-preview`\n    *   Box 3: `imagen-3`\n    *   Box 4: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`\n\n**Column 2: GOOGLE CLOUD (Google Blue Theme)**\n\n*   **Container:** A solid structural card with a fill color of soft, muted blue, reminiscent of Google Blue. Rounded corners and a thin, solid border in a slightly darker shade of blue.\n*   **Content:** Eight rectangular boxes stacked vertically within the container. Each box has a white background and contains the name of a Google Cloud service in a clear, sans-serif font. A very subtle drop shadow adds depth.\n    *   Box 1: `Cloud Run`\n    *   Box 2: `Cloud Storage`\n    *   Box 3: `Cloud SQL`\n    *   Box 4: `Cloud Firestore`\n    *   Box 5: `Secret Manager`\n    *   Box 6: `Cloud Pub/Sub`\n    *   Box 7: `Artifact Registry`\n    *   Box 8: `Cloud Tasks`\n\n**Column 3: APIs & SDKs (Google Green Theme)**\n\n*   **Container:** A \"connection card\" with a soft, muted sage green fill. Rounded corners and a thin, solid border in a slightly darker shade of sage.\n*   **Content:** Three rectangular boxes stacked vertically within the container. Each box has a white background and contains the name of an API or SDK in a clear, sans-serif font. A very subtle drop shadow adds depth.\n    *   Box 1: `Gmail API`\n    *   Box 2: `Google GenAI SDK`\n    *   Box 3: `Google Auth`\n\n**Column 4: LIBRARIES (Google Yellow Theme)**\n\n*   **Container:** A \"tooling card\" with a light, sunny yellow fill, almost a cream color. Rounded corners and a thin, solid border in a slightly darker shade of yellow.\n*   **Content:** Two rectangular boxes stacked vertically within the container. Each box has a white background and contains the name of a library in a clear, sans-serif font. A very subtle drop shadow adds depth.\n    *   Box 1: `Paper Banana`\n    *   Box 2: `Nano Banana`\n\n**Connections:** There are no arrows or explicit connections between the columns. The emphasis is on a clean, organized presentation of the Google Technology Stack components. The alignment and visual grouping implicitly suggest relationships and potential integrations.\n\n**Final Polish:** All boxes and containers are strictly aligned to maintain a professional and organized appearance. The use of soft, muted pastel colors adds visual appeal and reinforces the association with the Google Technology Stack. The card-style containers provide a modern and structured layout, resembling a \"Bento Box\" design.\n",
